                      Your code will be part of the application layer on both the client and the server side.
                      There is no need to modify either the network layer or the user interface layer.

                      This document also contains a documentation of the interface of the <a href="#viewapi">view module</a> and
                      <a href="#simapi">sim module</a>.
                      You should only use the documented interface to interact with the view layer.
                      Do not use any other functions or variables from <i>view.js</i> and related modules,
                      as this will cause the automated tests to fail.

                        You should not modify existing functions in the source code unless there
                        is a TODO comment in them. You may add new functions.

                    <div class="line"></div>

                    <p>
                      Implement basic distributed search functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When the button is clicked in the GUI, <i>app.search</i> is invoked
                      by the GUI layer. Your code should react by sending a search request to the server.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>In <i>app.search</i>, send a search request to the server</li>
                      <li>The server should forward the search request to all clients</li>
                      <li>Clients should handle incoming search requests and perform the actual search</li>
                      <li>The server should aggregate the results and return them to the requesting client</li>

                      <li>The requesting client must display the result to the user
                        by calling <i>view.setResultItems</i>.</li>
                      <li>The results shown to the user must be sorted by relevance (ascending sort by distance).</li>
                      <li>When the request is finished, the client must notify the
                        user interface layer by calling <i>view.updateViewState('ok')</i>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    Additionally, be aware that you are not alone in the world:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The system must continue to work even if new clients are
                        added while a search is in progress.</li>

                      <li>The server must be able to deal with multiple search
                        requests arriving at the same time.</li>
  
                      <li>The client must be able to start multiple search requests
                          at the same time (<i>app.search</i>called again with a
                           different queryView parameter before the previous 
                           invocation has finished).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p id="task1sim">You <b>MUST</b> use the <i>app.db.visitRange</i> function
                        to loop over the entities. In the callback you provide to
                        this function, you <b>MUST</b> include a call
                        to the simulator module as follows:</p>    
<pre><code>    app.db.visitRange(first, last, function(entity, idx, isLast) {
        // ...
        if (idx >= (first + last) / 2)
            if(sim.pointOfFailure('atWork') === 'stopWork')
                return 'abort';
        // ...
    }</code></pre>
                    <p>This allows the simulator module,and our <b>automated test cases</b>
                        to simulate errors in order to see how your code deals with them.</p>

                    <p>Using the "⥴ disconnect" icon, you can configure
                        the simulator to close a client's connection.</p>
                    <p>Using the "⚡ throw an exception" icon, you can configure
                        the simulator to throw an exception at various points.
                        There are two kinds of exceptions the simulator will throw:
                        ⚡ 'fatal' and ⛈ 'recoverable'.</p>
                    <p>You can configure these failures to occur either at
                    the beginning of <i>app.db.visitRange</i> ("before work"),
                    or at <i>sim.pointOfFailure('atWork')</i> after half of the
                    range has been searched.</p>
                    
                    <p>For this task, make your code handle those failures:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a client closes the connection to the server during a
                            search started by another client, the search results from the
                            other clients must still be shown to the user,
                            but the requesting client must report the error by calling
                            <i>view.updateViewState('failed')</i>.</li>
                        <li>When a 'recoverable' exception happens in a client,
                            it has to be reported to the server. The server should
                            still collect the results from the other clients. The requesting
                            client must report failure to the user as above.</li>
                        <li>When a 'fatal' exception happens in a client,
                            it has to be reported to the server. The server should
                            immediately report failure to the requesting client.</li>
                    </ul>

                        The client that initiated the search should display the progress to the user by repeatedly calling

                    you should remove them for your implementation, and put them
                    in the correct place. Only the queryView.oncancelclick

                    queryView.updateViewState, queryView.setResultItems to show
                    your search results. You must use them, because we will
                    replace the view with the test module to verify your query
                    results! Take a closer look on the documentation of these two
                    functions, and the examples in app.search, to use them
                    correctly and get your hard-earned points!</p>

                    your query, including threshold, entity to compare, and a
                    configuration object. The default implementation logs the
                    param object when the ▶ Button is clicked. Change some
                    setting in the search header (Threshold, enable some
                    advanced features with the 🕒🍀⛔ buttons on the left
                    side...) and take a look on the console output to see the
                    structure of the param object. Some (see task description)
                    features MUST NOT be active if the according param.config
                    flag is not set, i.e. error recovery MUST NOT be done if
                    param.config.tryRecoverEnabled is not true. The test system
                    will not work otherwise (so you will lose points). If you
                    implement any timeout features, use the timeout values in
                    the params.config object (unit is always milliseconds).</p>

                    <p>This function is used to deliver the
                    query state to the view, and the test system! You can call
                    it multiple times with state ‘running’, but after it has
                    been called with state ‘ok’ or ‘failed’,
                    <i>queryView.updateViewState</i> and <i>queryView.setResultItems</i> must
                    not be called until a new query is started.</p>

                    { ‘running’ | ‘ok’ | ‘failed’ }.</p>

                    <p><b>@param {string} msg:</b> Free text. Use it for
                    debugging or fun. The test system will not check this
                    value.</p>

                    <p><b>@param {number} progress:</b> Indicates the progress
                    in %, so valid values are 0-100. Use it if you decide to
                    implement the <a href="#progress">progress feature</a>.
                    Otherwise don't supply this argument.</p>

                    <p>Call this function to display matching 3d models, and to
                    report your matches to the test system. You can call it
                    multiple times, but don’t call it after <i>updateViewState</i>
                    was called with state ‘ok’ or ‘failed’ (until <i>app.search</i>
                    is called again). If you call it multiple times, the last given
                    matches array will be compared by the test system. Hint: if
                    a 3d model occurs multiple times in the matches array it
                    will be marked with a red border in the view. Maybe the test
                    system shows a different reaction ;)</p>

                    <p><b>@param {array} matches:</b> An array of matching 3d
                    objects. See API examples in <i>app.search</i> for object
                    structure. Hint: The array elements have the same structure
                    as the object returned by compareEntity. You are responsible
                    to sort this array before.</p>

                    you MUST use this function. If you do so, the delay, stop
                    working, and exception simulation will work. The test system
                    assumes to be able to simulate these conditions, or in other
                    words, if you don't use it you will lose a lot of
                    points.</p>

                    <p>If you want to stop the ‘loop’ i.e. because you are
                    implementing the user cancel feature, just return the string
                    ‘abort’.</p>

                    throw an exception’, and ‘☠ visitRange stops’ settings of
                    your client, and observe the behaviour of the Api example in
                    app.serach.</p>

                    <p>The visitor function is called by a timer callback, so
                    think about exceptions in this function. (As you should
                    always think about in an asynchronous system. For those who
                    didn't understand the threading model of such a system… it’s
                    really time read about it)</p>

                    is the last visited element.</p>

                    <p>This is just for your convenience, you don’t need to use
                    this helper, but if you do so, you can switch on/off logging
                    of all clients and the server at the ☍Network Panel to avoid
                    logging spam.</p>

                    <p>The function is similar to console.log/warn/error/trace.
                    additionally it distinguishes tree log categories (⥴ app, ⥂
                    own, ☍ net) which can be enabled/disabled separately. The
                    provided network implementation logs all in/outgoing
                    messages as ‘net’. You can use ‘app’ and ‘own’ for your
                    purposes.</p>

                    <p><b>@param {string} logCategory:</b> Valid values are

                    <p><b>@param {string} consoleFunction:</b>
                    selects the console function to use, so
                    valid values are ‘log’, ‘warn’, ‘error’, ‘trace’... (see
                    console documentation). Hint: you can filter by the used
                    function in chrome developer console.</p>
                    <p><b>@param 3 - n:</b>
                    The remaining parameters are given to the console

                    <p>This helper is used to simulate exceptions,
                    disconnections, or starvation of workers. In real systems
                    the system has to cope with such circumstances.</p>

                    <p>You <b>MUST</b> include one call to this function as
                    specified in <a href="#task1sim">Task 1</a>.</p>

                    <p>In order to make testing your code more convenient, you
                    may also include further calls to this function in your
                    code.</p>

                    <p>This function will throw an exception or close the given
                    connection c, if enabled in simconfig and the given
                    pointOfFailure (i.e. ‘u1’) argument matches the configured
                    point of failure (i.e. user defined 1). Except as specified
                    in <a href="#task1sim">Task 1</a>, do not use other point of
                    failure values like ‘beforeWork’.</p>

                    <p>We distinguish two kinds of exceptions, you can choose
                    wich one is thrown at the config panel. First the ⚡ ‘fatal’
                    exception, the query should always be aborted if such
                    exception occurs. And second the ⛈ ‘recoverable’ exception.
                    If you choose to implement any error recovery features, this
                    exception as well as timeouts should trigger them (as
                    mentioned bevore only if param.config.tryRecoverEnabled is
                    true).</p>


                    <p><b>@param {string} pointOfFailure:</b>
