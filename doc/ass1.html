                    We propose a client-server application for performing a distributed search of 3D objects.
                    The first task is a preparation for the actual seach and its main goal is transmitting data in the network
                    and synchronizing the clients. Each client has a configuration that lets the user enable different log levels,
                    error simulations and search delays for every client.
                    Each client can see the configuration of all clients in its view(GUI) as seen in Figure 1.
                    This configuration will have to be synchronized.
                    We are going
                    to call such a configuration associated with a client or with the server Node and the associated object in the code NetworkInfo.
                    </p>

                    The main componets of the proposed system are the server and the client.
                    The client is a thin client: the Chrome browser, running the client side
                    software components. The server side application runs in the nodejs
                    runtime environment and consists of the Http Server and WebSocket Server
                    software components.
                    Therefore the server communicates via:
                    <ul>
                    <li>a http port: for GUI, loading 3D Objects
                    data from database</li>
                    <li>a websocket port: for synchronisation of network information
                    and for the actual search</li>
                    </ul>
                    In the context of this exercise, the distributed search clients are also workers.

                    </figure>
                    As seen in Figure 3:

                        <dd>- view layer</dd>
                    </dl>
                    The 3D objects database itself is just an array that has to be loaded with AJAX. For the
                    purpose of the exercise no real DBMS is used. Only the client accesses the
                    database, as the server is only responsible for delegating the search further to
                    workers (clients).
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    The view is already implemented for you.
                    When view is loaded (in the client), it calls the <i>app.init()</i> function. This calls <i>network.connect</i>,
                    which connects the client to the websocket that the server is listening to.



                    When a Networkinfo is changed in view, app gets an event. In section 5, we describe
                    what should happen next and it is also part of the student tasks.

                    This part serves as an introduction to javascript. The 2 subtasks
                    are independent from the rest.

                    <h2>Task: Ajax request</h2>
                    <p>

                    The database item is already given. It has a tumbnail url and
                    a feature vector url. The thumbnails is used just for visualisation purposes in the GUI
                    while the feature vector is the way we represent a 3D object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Because of the potentially big
                    size of the database that has to be loaded by the client, loading the objects synchronously (always waiting for the previous object to be finished)
                    could take a long time. Loading the objects asynchronously however does not imply waiting for a response before sending
                    the next request. The objects are loaded as the responses are received. This means that even if some
                    objects need a longer time to load, other objects can be loaded in the meanwhile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The feature vector has to be loaded asynchronously.
                    This has to be implemented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>
                    or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/">jQuery.getJSON</a>.
                    When data arrives use <i>dbitem.setFeature(...)</i> to set the feature
                    vector and <i>dbitem.setFeature(undefined)</i> in case an error occurs.

                    <h1>Network Overview</h1>

                    The server network top interface consists of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>method: <i>network.connections[x].send(msg)</i> sends message <i>msg</i> over connection with ID x.
                        <li>method: <i>network.sendBroadcast(msg)</i> sends message <i>msg</i> to all connections.
                        <li>method: <i>network.sendMulticast(receivers, msg)</i> sends message <i>msg</i> to a list of
                        receivers (array of connection IDs).
                        <li>event: <i>network.onMessage(connection, parsed)</i> is called when an incoming message is received. Connection is the
                        connection object (containing the connection ID), parsed is the parsed message.
                        <li>event: <i>network.onConnectionChanged(state, connection)</i> is called when a connection is accepted or ended
                        (state can be 'Connected' or 'Disconnected).
                    </ul>

                    The client network top interface consists of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>method: <i>network.connect(url)</i> opens a websocket conntection to the given url.
                        <li>method: <i>network.connection.send(msg)</i> sends message <i>msg</i> over the connection to the server
                        <li>method: <i>network.connection.close()</i> closes the connection.
                        <li>event: <i>network.onConnectionChanged(state, connection)</i> is called when a connection is initiated, opened or ended.
                        (state can be 'Connecting', 'Connected' or 'Disconnected)
                    </ul>


                    <p>
                    In order to understand these methods and events better, we describe as an example
                    what happens when a log level is enabled by a client.

                    <!--<figure>
                    <a href="img/Overview.png"><img src="img/Overview.png" class="imgright"></a>
                    <figcaption class="captionleft">Fig. 5 System class diagram</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    -->

                    We assume the following scenario: 3 clients are connected: c1, c2, c3.
                    c1 changes the log level of the server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <i>c1.view</i> calls <i>c1.networkinfo.activeChange</i>. This uses the network to send the
                    message to the server. The server gets the message and its network (server.network) triggers an <i>onMessage</i>
                    event. <i>server.app</i> 'recognizes' the NetworkInfo message and dispatches it to <i>app.networkInfo.passiveChange</i>.

                    <i>app.networkInfo.passiveChange</i> updates the server's cache and sends a multicast to all clients except to the
                    sender. The message reception in the clients happens in a similar way to what happened in the server, the
                    difference being that <i>client.networkInfo.passivechange</i> updates the client cache and the client gui (for each client).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We can see that <i>client.networkInfo.activeChange</i> is responsible for the change in the networkInfo of the client
                    that got an event directly from its view (event in browser) while <i>client.networkInfo.activeChange</i> handles the
                    changes that other clients triggered.
                    </p>

                    <h1>5. Data Synchronisation</h1>
                    <div class="line"></div>

                    <p>
                    The exercise referes to synchronising Node objects. In this context
                    the Node objects contain configuration information valuable for the clients like enabling/disabling
                    output, search speed, crash behavoiur and other. Each client has an assiociated
                    Node visible by each of the other clients. Each client can modify the configuration of the other clients. In order
                    for the configurations to be set correctly and to be up to date, data synchronisation is necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When refering to the implementation, synchronisation is needed in 3 places: when a client connects, when a
                    client disconnects, when the GUI is changed by someone (when some client modifies someone's configuration from the GUI).
                    A network info message is used to communicate such configuration changes.
                    </p>

                    <figcaption class="captionleft">Fig. 7 Node Object Class Diagram</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The datablock to be synchronized is saved in the server in a map with client ids as keys and client configs (nodes) as values.
                        A <i>networkInfoMsg</i> contains this data as JSON Dict.
                        One can see in Figure 7 that a server node is different from a client node.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When a client gets a networkInfoMsg it has to update its cache and its GUI accordingly.
                        When a Node is not present in the message then it means there are no changes to be done
                        about this node. If a node is 'deadbeef' then the node does not exist anymore and the
                        receiver has to delete it too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We see that (only) the client/GUI can change the content of a node. It is just the server
                        that can add or remove nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a very basic method for syncronisation. Real distributed objects are more complex.

                    <h2>Connect</h2>

                    <p>
                        When a new client connects, the server gives it an id and a config.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the client connects to the server, it gets a message back with the id that the server gives to it.
                        Then, the id is saved in the server cache together with the configuration that is attributed from the config file: the server
                        adds the new [id,  node] to its cache map of configs.
                        The server cache is important because the server needs to send the whole network configuration to the new node.
                        A network info message containing the whole configuration with all clients (including the new client) is broadcasted
                        so that all clients can add the new client with their other nodes and so that the new client also has the nodes list.

                    <h2>Disconnect</h2>
                    <p>
                    There are 3 types of disconnect situations:
                    <ul>
                        <li> normal WS close
                        <li> timeout
                        <!--error?-->
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    When a client disconnects, the server sets its associated node to 'deadbeef' and updates its
                    cache by deleting the node. Then it broadcasts the new list, where the dead node is 'deadbeef' to
                    the rest of the clients in the network.

                    <h2>Change Synchronized Data</h2>


                    <p>
                    The change of the config in the GUI triggers a change of some config of aclient. This causes an active change
                    in the active client and a passive change in all the other clients.
                    The client updates its cache with the new config and sends the new list of configurations to the server as a
                    <i>networkInfoMsg</i>. The server receives the network info message and updates its cache, sending a multicast to all nodes
                    except the one who sent the message. When the other clients get the network info message they have to perform a passive change
                    by updating their cache and GUI.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    If a client loses its connection to the server it deletes its cache so that in case it connects again it doesn't
                    have outdated information.

                    While the implementation tasks in assigment 1 are limited in scope, the following conceptual task deals with the complete intended functionality of the distributed search system.

                    <h2>Task: Protocol Design Specification</h2>

                    <p>
                    Write a design document specifying the client/server protocol for the distributed search. The document should contain a list of all messages that make up the protocol and a concise description of their semantics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The document should have a maximum of 3 pages. We encourage the use of diagrams (for example: sequence diagrams), therefore a maximum of 1 page of
                    text (in total) is allowed. There is no introduction needed in the design document; you do not need to summarize the problem statement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Hand in the document as a PDF file in the <b>/doc</b> folder of the project (next to the client and server folders).

                        As you are going to have to present the document during the first 5 minutes of your student interview (Abgabegespr&auml;ch)
                        it is possible that you
                        also prepare a short slideshow (5 minutes) presenting the documentation. This step is optional. If you decide
                        to prepare this, your slideshow presentation document does not have to be in your repository. It is not graded as it is just
                        intended to be a tool to help
                        you present your solution and to show that you understood the assignment.
