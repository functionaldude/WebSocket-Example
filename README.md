Installation
============

Installing required packages:
-----------------------------

You need to install the [Node.js JavaScript
runtime](https://nodejs.org).

On deb-based Linux distributions, use the following command:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs

On Macs with the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager installed, use:

    brew install node

All required libraries are pre-installed in the repository.

Download test data from https://student.cgv.tugraz.at/assets/db.zip
and unpack it to a folder `db`.

Starting the server:
--------------------

    cd server
    nodejs server.js

note: on some systems the command is `node` instead of `nodejs`.

Starting the client:
--------------------

http://localhost:1337/client/view.html
